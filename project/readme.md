the hls zip contains the vivado hls project for the IP CORE that implements the equalizer


the vivado zip contains the project, it is based on the RealTimeAudioCode from the teacher, so if you cant get the project to work, try using that one and import the core yourself.
the code should run without problems.

currently the code doesnt work very well. the classes instantiated lose their data when the threads/tasks are created
